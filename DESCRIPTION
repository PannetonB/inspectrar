Description: The main function in inspectrar is InSpectoR. It opens a data set comprising spectral data from
    several sources on a given set of samples. Samples are described
    in a Y file and spectra from each source (e.g. NIR, fluorescence, Raman...)
    are stored in XData files. All spectra can be visualised and some
    data cleaning and manipulation can be performed. Spectra can then be
    preprocessed. Further exploration of the data set can be performed
    based on principal component analysis. Finally, preprocessed data
    can be used to develop pls models for classification or prediction of
    a continuous variable. Trained models can be applied to new data.
    TESTED ON WINDOWS 10.
