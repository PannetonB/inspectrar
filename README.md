# inspectrar

This R package bundles __InSpectoR__, a GUI based script for spectra data visualisation 
and editing. It also contains tools for developing basic chemometrics model. Data sets
are provided to get you started. A few functions that may be of general interest are
also provided.

To install in R, use the _**devtools**_ package and the following command:  

__devtools::install_github("pannetonb/inspectrar", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))__

The default build_opts has a "--no-build-vignettes". Removing forces building the vignettes.
After installation, you may have to restart **R** or **RStudio**.
